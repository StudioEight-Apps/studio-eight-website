  <h2>1. The Service</h2>
  <p>Whisper: Smart Journaling provides journaling prompts and generates personalized mantras and guidance. The App is designed to support reflection and emotional well-being. <strong>It is not medical, psychological, or professional advice.</strong></p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the equivalent age of digital consent in your country) to use the App. If you are under 18, you represent that you have parental consent.</p>

  <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any activity under it.</li>
    <li>Provide accurate information when creating or signing into an account (e.g., Sign in with Apple or Google).</li>
    <li>Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access or use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Whisper offers one premium tier with three subscription options: Weekly, Monthly, and Annual — all granting full access to the app’s features.</li>
    <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
    <li>Free trials, if offered, will automatically convert to paid subscriptions unless canceled before the trial period ends.</li>
    <li>Prices vary by region and are displayed clearly in-app before purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. User Content</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of all journal entries you create within the App. By using the App, you grant Studio Eight a limited license to process your content solely to operate the App (for example, to generate mantras or guidance). We do not publish, sell, or share your private entries.</p>

  <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App for unlawful or harmful purposes.</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or disrupt the App’s functionality.</li>
    <li>Submit or store content that infringes upon others’ rights, is abusive, or illegal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, its branding, design, and all related intellectual property belong to Studio Eight. You are granted a personal, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the App for non-commercial purposes only.</p>

  <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy. For a detailed explanation of how we collect, use, and protect your data, please see

  <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that its results will meet your expectations.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Studio Eight shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if you violate these Terms. You may also stop using the App at any time. Termination does not affect your payment obligations for the current billing period.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms periodically. Any material changes will be reflected on this page and, when appropriate, communicated in the App. Your continued use of Whisper after updates means you accept the revised Terms.</p>

  <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, unless your local laws require otherwise. Any disputes will be handled by courts located in Delaware.</p>
